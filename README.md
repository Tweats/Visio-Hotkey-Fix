# Visio-Hotkey-Fix
; This AutoHotKey script fixes the Union Shapes hotkey and adds a hotkey for Subtract Shapes for Microsoft Visio. 
; It also rebinds the common tools so that the hotkeys are all acccessible without moving your hand.


; Change Notes:

; (v.1.2) Added BlockInput commands to Union/Subtract Shapes hotkeys to prevent errors from user input while script runs.
;		  Removed IfWinActive command. Added Change Notes section. Renamed file to Visio Hotkey Fix

; (v.1.1) Changed Subtract Shapes keybind from Ctrl+I to Ctrl+Y so as not to interfere with Set Italics default hotkey.
